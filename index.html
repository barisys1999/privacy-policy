    <section>
      <h2>1. Overview</h2>
      <p>This privacy policy explains how <strong>BarisByteGames</strong> (\"we\", \"our\") collects, uses, and shares user data across the mobile games and apps we publish (collectively, the \"Games\"). This policy applies to all Games published by BarisByteGames unless a specific Game lists its own separate privacy policy. If a Game has its own policy, that policy will apply to that Game in addition to this corporate policy.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>2. Scope</h2>
      <p>This policy covers data collection and usage for all games published by BarisByteGames, including but not limited to: game progress, gameplay telemetry, analytics, advertising, and in-app purchases. We may update the list of Games from time to time; for a current list of published titles visit our website or contact us.</p>
    </section>

      <h2>3. Information We Collect</h2>
      <p><strong>A. In-App Data:</strong> Game progress, scores, settings, and gameplay preferences.</p>
      <p><strong>B. Technical Data:</strong> Device model, operating system, unique device identifiers (e.g., advertising ID), IP address, and mobile network information.</p>
      <p><strong>C. Analytics Data:</strong> Game usage statistics (session duration, most played levels, crash reports) — stored in an anonymized or aggregated form where possible.</p>
      <p><strong>D. Advertising & Advertising Identifiers:</strong> When ads are served, advertising identifiers may be used to deliver relevant ads and measure performance.</p>
      <p><strong>E. Payment Data:</strong> For in-app purchases, payment processing is handled by third-party providers (Google Play / App Store). We do not store users' full payment details.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>4. How We Collect Data</h2>
      <p>Data is collected via the Games themselves, in-app forms, automatic telemetry, and third-party SDKs (e.g., analytics, advertising). Third-party services we commonly use include, but are not limited to: Google Analytics for Firebase, AdMob, Unity Ads, and platform payment processors. Specific Games may use additional third-party services — such services will be listed in the Game’s in-app or store listing where required.</p>
